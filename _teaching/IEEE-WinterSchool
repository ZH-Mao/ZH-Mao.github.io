The Winter School on SLAM in Deformable Environments is hosted by the Robotics Institute (Centre for Autonomous Systems) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, over five days from 5 to 9 July 2021 (during the southern hemisphere winter). 
The School aimed to promote research on robot localization, mapping, and navigation in deformable environments. 
The school was co-sponsored by IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and Australia Robotics and Automation Association.
In the winter school, attendees formed groups and each group worked on one of the group projects designed for them. 
I was one of the group project supervisors who were responsible for designing projects and assisting attendees in our groups.
