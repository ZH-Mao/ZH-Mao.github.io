Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) (Australia).

I earned my Master's degree in Precision Instrument and Machinery from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (China) and my
Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation from [Hefei University of Technology](https://en.hfut.edu.cn/) (China). 
Currently, I am doing research in a [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) team. 
And my research topic is three-dimensional fusion for transesophageal echocardiography, which aims to overcome one important drawback (i.e., limited field of view) of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) in both rigid and deformable scenarios. In the recent three years of my Ph.D. study, I have published several papers in [Computers in Biology and Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-in-biology-and-medicine)(IF=6.698), Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS, a top conference in robotics),  [IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros) (IROS, one of the largest and most impacting robotics research conferences worldwide), [Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209)(IF=4.506), and [International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention](http://www.miccai.org/) (MICCAI, a top conference in medical image computing and computer assisted intervention). Please find details on my current research on my [publications](publication) page and my previous publication on my homepage of [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-t9imkAAAAJ&hl=en).

#Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) are increasingly used in the clinic for assessing cardiac anatomy and function but it suffers from a limited field of view of ultrasound transducer.
