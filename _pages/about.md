Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) (UTS, Australia) and this is my last semester. I am supervised by [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Liang.Zhao) and [Prof. Shoudong Huang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang) in a [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) (SLAM) team at UTS. 

I earned my Master's degree in Precision Instrument and Machinery from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (China) and my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation from [Hefei University of Technology](https://en.hfut.edu.cn/) (China). I commenced my Ph.D. study in August 2019. And my research topic is three-dimensional fusion for transesophageal echocardiography, which aims to overcome one important drawback (i.e., limited field of view) of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) in both rigid and deformable scenarios. In the recent three years of my Ph.D. study, I have published several papers in:

- [International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention](http://www.miccai.org/) (MICCAI, a top conference in medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention). I was awarded the [Student Travel Award](http://www.miccai.org/about-miccai/awards/student-travel-awards/) which is "To reward the best (such as highest scoring) first author students and to subsidise their attendance to the present their work at the annual MICCAI conference";

- [Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209) (IF=4.506);

- [Robotics: Science and Systems](https://roboticsconference.org/) (RSS, a top conference in robotics);

- [IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros) (IROS, one of the largest and most impacting robotics research conferences worldwide);

- [Computers in Biology and Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-in-biology-and-medicine) (IF=6.698).

Please find details on my current research on my [publications](publication) page and my previous publications on my homepage of [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3-t9imkAAAAJ&hl=en).

During my Ph.D. study, I have been also working as a casual staff (tutor) in UTS for years. In the future, I am planning to pursue a career in academia. Therefore, I am now searching for a postdoctoral position. If you are interested in my research, you are warmly welcome to contact me!
